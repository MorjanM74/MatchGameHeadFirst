This is myFirst Desktop application Game, it is a game where we have 8 type of animals with one copy for each of them (16 in total) 
iserted inside a board and we have to select each animal with its copy, whenever we select one it disappear then we have to select a second animal,
if it his original the first one selected and the second one disappears, if it was't his copy the first one we selected reappear and the second one we selected
does't get effected.
with a timer to count how many seconds it took the player to finish the game.
